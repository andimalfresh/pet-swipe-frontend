# PetSwipe

PetSwipe is a mobile app that assists people in finding pets and pets in finding homes.

# User Experience

PetSwipe allows the user to choose whether they are an adopter or an adoptee.

The user either logs in or signs up.

The user can create and adoptee or adopter account depending on whether they are trying to rehome or adopt an animal.

Users who are trying to rehome pets can create a profile including pet information.

Users who are adopters are given pet profiles, one at a time, and are able to like or dislike a pet.

Pets that the adopter likes are stored in a favorites list where the adopter can see pet information and contact the adoptee's owners or caregivers via email.
